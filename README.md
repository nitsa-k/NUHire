# CS 3200 Final Project - NUHire

My product is a re-imagined version of Northeastern's current co-op/job searching platform, NUWorks. It allows employers to post open jobs, students to apply to them, and co-op advisors to keep track of students in their class and their job search progress (among other things).

Get and post requests relevant to each major persona (student, advisor, employer) are located in their respective folders. Each has a comment above it describing the data it is retreiving/working with.
